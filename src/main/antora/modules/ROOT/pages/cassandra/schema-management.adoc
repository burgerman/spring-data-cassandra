= Schema Management

Apache Cassandra is a data store that requires a schema definition prior to any data interaction.
Spring Data for Apache Cassandra can support you with schema creation.

[[cql-specifications]]
== CQL Specifications

CQL specifications are an abstraction to represent CQL DDL actions such as table creations or keyspace drops.
Specifications are available for the following CQL object types:

* Keyspace
* Table
* Index
* User-defined Type

NOTE: Variants of Cassandra can support Materialized Views, User-defined functions, roles and many more object types.
Spring Data for Apache Cassandra provides only specifications for the above listed types.

These can be used to CREATE, ALTER, and DROP CQL objects through a fluent interface. `SpecificationBuilder` is the entry point to build such a specification.
You can use later on `CqlGenerator.toCql(â€¦)` to easily render CQL from a specification.

See the following examples to create a specification for keyspace creation, table creation, and index creation.

You can use specifications together with the configuration API to define keyspace creation and schema actions.

[[keyspaces-and-lifecycle-scripts]]
== Keyspaces and Lifecycle Scripts

The first thing to start with is a Cassandra keyspace.
A keyspace is a logical grouping of tables that share the same replication factor and replication strategy.
Keyspace management is located in the `CqlSession` configuration, which has the `KeyspaceSpecification` and startup and shutdown CQL script execution.

Declaring a keyspace with a specification allows creating and dropping of the Keyspace.
It derives CQL from the specification so that you need not write CQL yourself.
The following example specifies a Cassandra keyspace by using XML:

              <cassandra:data-center name="bar" replication-factor="2" />
            </cassandra:replication>
      </cassandra:keyspace>

    </cassandra:session>
</beans>
----
====

NOTE: Keyspace creation allows rapid bootstrapping without the need of external keyspace management.
This can be useful for certain scenarios but should be used with care.
Dropping a keyspace on application shutdown removes the keyspace and all data from the tables in the keyspace.

[[cassandra.schema-management.initializing]]
== Initializing a `SessionFactory`

The `org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.cql.session.init` package provides support for initializing an existing `SessionFactory`.
You may sometimes need to initialize a keyspace that runs on a server somewhere.

[[cassandra.schema-management.initializing.config]]
=== Initializing a Keyspace

You can provide arbitrary CQL that is executed on `CqlSession` initialization and shutdown in the configured keyspace, as the following Java configuration example shows:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
include::example$KeyspacePopulatorConfiguration.java[tags=class]
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
----
<cassandra:initialize-keyspace session-factory-ref="cassandraSessionFactory">
    <cassandra:script location="classpath:com/foo/cql/db-schema.cql"/>
    <cassandra:script location="classpath:com/foo/cql/db-test-data.cql"/>
</cassandra:initialize-keyspace>
----
====

The preceding example runs the two specified scripts against the keyspace.
The first script creates a schema, and the second populates tables with a test data set.
The script locations can also be patterns with wildcards in the usual Ant style used for resources in Spring (for example, `classpath{asterisk}:/com/foo/{asterisk}{asterisk}/cql/{asterisk}-data.cql`).
If you use a pattern, the scripts are run in the lexical order of their URL or filename.

The default behavior of the keyspace initializer is to unconditionally run the provided scripts.
This may not always be what you want -- for instance, if you run the scripts against a keyspace that already has test data in it.
The likelihood of accidentally deleting data is reduced by following the common pattern (shown earlier) of creating the tables first and then inserting the data.
The first step fails if the tables already exist.

However, to gain more control over the creation and deletion of existing data, the XML namespace provides a few additional options.
The first is a flag to switch the initialization on and off.
You can set this according to the environment (such as pulling a boolean value from system properties or from an environment bean).
The following example gets a value from a system property:

====
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
<cassandra:initialize-keyspace session-factory-ref="cassandraSessionFactory"
    enabled="#{systemProperties.INITIALIZE_KEYSPACE}">    <1>
    <cassandra:script location="..."/>
</cassandra:initialize-database>
----

<1> Get the value for `enabled` from a system property called `INITIALIZE_KEYSPACE`.
====

The second option to control what happens with existing data is to be more tolerant of failures.
To this end, you can control the ability of the initializer to ignore certain errors in the CQL it executes from the scripts, as the following example shows:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
include::example$KeyspacePopulatorFailureConfiguration.java[tags=class]
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
----
<cassandra:initialize-keyspace session-factory-ref="cassandraSessionFactory" ignore-failures="DROPS">
    <cassandra:script location="..."/>
</cassandra:initialize-database>
----
====

In the preceding example, we are saying that we expect that, sometimes, the scripts are run against an empty keyspace, and there are some `DROP` statements in the scripts that would, therefore, fail.
So failed CQL `DROP` statements will be ignored, but other failures will cause an exception.
This is useful if you don't want tu use support `DROP ... IF EXISTS` (or similar) but you want to unconditionally remove all test data before re-creating it.
In that case the first script is usually a set of `DROP` statements, followed by a set of `CREATE` statements.

The `ignore-failures` option can be set to `NONE` (the default), `DROPS` (ignore failed drops), or `ALL` (ignore all failures).

Each statement should be separated by `;` or a new line if the `;` character is not present at all in the script.
You can control that globally or script by script, as the following example shows:

====
.Java
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
include::example$SessionFactoryInitializerConfiguration.java[tags=class]
----

.XML
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
----
<cassandra:initialize-keyspace session-factory-ref="cassandraSessionFactory" separator="@@">
    <cassandra:script location="classpath:com/myapp/cql/db-schema.cql" separator=";"/>
    <cassandra:script location="classpath:com/myapp/cql/db-test-data-1.cql"/>
    <cassandra:script location="classpath:com/myapp/cql/db-test-data-2.cql"/>
</cassandra:initialize-keyspace>
----
====

In this example, the two `test-data` scripts use `@@` as statement separator and only the `db-schema.cql` uses `;`.
This configuration specifies that the default separator is `@@` and overrides that default for the `db-schema` script.

If you need more control than you get from the XML namespace, you can use the `SessionFactoryInitializer` directly and define it as a component in your application.

[[cassandra.schema-management.initializing.component]]
==== Initialization of Other Components that Depend on the Keyspace

A large class of applications (those that do not use the database until after the Spring context has started) can use the database initializer with no further complications.
If your application is not one of those, you might need to read the rest of this section.

The database initializer depends on a `SessionFactory` instance and runs the scripts provided in its initialization callback (analogous to an `init-method` in an XML bean definition, a `@PostConstruct` method in a component, or the `afterPropertiesSet()` method in a component that implements `InitializingBean`).
If other beans depend on the same data source and use the session factory in an initialization callback, there might be a problem because the data has not yet been initialized.
A common example of this is a cache that initializes eagerly and loads data from the database on application startup.

To get around this issue, you have two options: change your cache initialization strategy to a later phase or ensure that the keyspace initializer is initialized first.

Changing your cache initialization strategy might be easy if the application is in your control and not otherwise.
Some suggestions for how to implement this include:

* Make the cache initialize lazily on first usage, which improves application startup time.
* Have your cache or a separate component that initializes the cache implement `Lifecycle` or `SmartLifecycle`.
When the application context starts, you can automatically start a `SmartLifecycle` by setting its `autoStartup` flag, and you can manually start a `Lifecycle` by calling `ConfigurableApplicationContext.start()` on the enclosing context.
* Use a Spring `ApplicationEvent` or similar custom observer mechanism to trigger the cache initialization. `ContextRefreshedEvent` is always published by the context when it is ready for use (after all beans have been initialized), so that is often a useful hook (this is how the `SmartLifecycle` works by default).

Ensuring that the keyspace initializer is initialized first can also be easy.
Some suggestions on how to implement this include:

* Rely on the default behavior of the Spring `BeanFactory`, which is that beans are initialized in registration order.
You can easily arrange that by adopting the common practice of a set of `<import/>` elements in XML configuration that order your application modules and ensuring that the database and database initialization are listed first.
* Separate the `SessionFactory` and the business components that use it and control their startup order by putting them in separate `ApplicationContext` instances (for example, the parent context contains the `SessionFactory`, and the child context contains the business components).
This structure is common in Spring web applications but can be more generally applied.
* Use the Schema management for xref:cassandra/schema-management.adoc#cassandra.schema-management.tables[Tables and User-defined Types] to initialize the keyspace using Spring Data Cassandra's built-in schema generator.

[[cassandra.schema-management.tables]]
== Tables and User-defined Types

Spring Data for Apache Cassandra approaches data access with mapped entity classes that fit your data model.
You can use these entity classes to create Cassandra table specifications and user type definitions.

Schema creation is tied to `CqlSession` initialization by `SchemaAction`.
The following actions are supported:

* `SchemaAction.NONE`: No tables or types are created or dropped.
This is the default setting.
* `SchemaAction.CREATE`: Create tables, indexes, and user-defined types from entities annotated with `@Table` and types annotated with `@UserDefinedType`.
Existing tables or types cause an error if you tried to create the type.
* `SchemaAction.CREATE_IF_NOT_EXISTS`: Like `SchemaAction.CREATE` but with `IF NOT EXISTS` applied.
Existing tables or types do not cause any errors but may remain stale.
* `SchemaAction.RECREATE`: Drops and recreates existing tables and types that are known to be used.
Tables and types that are not configured in the application are not dropped.
* `SchemaAction.RECREATE_DROP_UNUSED`: Drops all tables and types and recreates only known tables and types.

NOTE: `SchemaAction.RECREATE` and `SchemaAction.RECREATE_DROP_UNUSED` drop your tables and lose all data.
`RECREATE_DROP_UNUSED` also drops tables and types that are not known to the application.

[[enabling-tables-and-user-defined-types-for-schema-management]]
=== Enabling Tables and User-Defined Types for Schema Management

xref:object-mapping.adoc#mapping.usage[Metadata-based Mapping] explains object mapping with conventions and annotations.
To prevent unwanted classes from being created as a table or a type, schema management is only active for entities annotated with `@Table` and user-defined types annotated with `@UserDefinedType`.
Entities are discovered by scanning the classpath.
Entity scanning requires one or more base packages.
Tuple-typed columns that use `TupleValue` do not provide any typing details.
Consequently, you must annotate such column properties with `@CassandraType(type = TUPLE, typeArguments = â€¦)`
to specify the desired column type.

The following example shows how to specify entity base packages in XML configuration:
